# Challenge
1. Make views near the top of the scroll view fade out to 0 opacity 
â€“ I would suggest starting at about 200 points from the top.
2. Make views adjust their scale depending on their vertical position, 
with views near the bottom being large and views near the top being small. 
I would suggest going no smaller than 50% of the regular size.
3. For a real challenge make the views change color as you scroll. 
For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(hue:saturation:brightness:) initializer,
 feeding in varying values for the hue.


```Swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let colors: [Color] = [.red, .green, .blue, .orange, .pink, .purple, .yellow]

    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { fullView in
            ScrollView(.vertical) {
                ForEach(0..<50) { index in
                    GeometryReader { proxy in
                        let minY = proxy.frame(in: .global).minY
                        
                        Text("Row #\(index)")
                            .font(.title)
                            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                            .background(Color(hue: minY/fullView.size.height, saturation: 0.7, brightness: 0.7)) //3
                            .opacity(
                                minY < 200 ?
                            Double(max(0, 1 - (200 - minY) / 200)) : 1)//1
                            .scaleEffect(min(0.5, (minY / fullView.size.height)) + 0.2) //2
                            .rotation3DEffect(.degrees(proxy.frame(in: .global).minY - fullView.size.height / 2) / 5, axis: (x: 0, y: 1, z: 0))
                    }
                    .frame(height: 40)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
