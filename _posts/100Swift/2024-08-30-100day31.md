# Challenge

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.<br>

```swift
    func isPossible(word: String) -> Bool {
        var tempWord = rootWord
        
        for letter in word {
            if let pos = tempWord.firstIndex(of:letter) {
                tempWord.remove(at: pos)
                
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        if (tempWord.count < 3 || tempWord == word){
            return false
        }
        return true
    }
```

<br><br>

2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.<br>

```swift
        .toolbar{
            Button("Start", action: startGame)
        }
```

3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.<br>

```swift
   func addNewWord() {
        let answer = newWord.lowercased().trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines )
        guard answer.count > 0 else {return }
        
        guard isOriginal(word: answer) else {
            wordError(title: "Word used already", message: "Be more original!")
            return
        }
        
        guard isPossible(word: answer) else {
            wordError(title: "word not possible", message: "You can't spell that word from '\(rootWord)'!")
            return
        }
        
        guard isReal(word: answer) else {
            wordError(title: "Word not recognized", message: "You can't just make them up you know!")
            return
        }
        
        withAnimation{
            usedWords.insert(answer, at: 0)
        }
        newWord = ""
        userScore += answer.count
    }
```
